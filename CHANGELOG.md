# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- The menu-bar dropdown stays within the available screen height and scrolls
  long account lists, keeping the bottom entries and toolbar accessible.

## 0.2.5 - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Claude accounts now show per-model weekly pools (currently the Fable
  share of the weekly limit) as labeled weekly rows, read from the
  usage endpoint's `limits` array. Because the menu-bar badge tracks
  the tightest window, an exhausted per-model pool now surfaces there
  instead of hiding behind a comfortable all-models number.
- Claude scoped-limit decoding now keeps distinct model identities separate
  and degrades safely when the optional provider payload drifts.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-08-07

### Added

- A Claude login that belongs to several chat-capable organizations now
  offers a checkbox list at connection time and creates one account per
  selected organization, all sharing the login's browser session.

### Fixed

- Reconnecting a Claude account now validates against the account's
  own organization instead of silently rebinding to the login's first
  organization, and repairs sibling accounts from the same login when
  their organizations are present.
- Refreshes, reconnects, and removals no longer race each other:
  in-flight refreshes finish before reconnects or removals touch
  shared state, and all persisted-state writes go through one
  serialized queue so concurrent operations cannot revert each other
  on disk.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- Timeline bars now anchor remaining quota to the reset edge, so a
  fill that reaches the now-line means consumption is on pace, a gap
  before it shows the overdraft, and a fill crossing it shows surplus.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Removing a Claude account works again. Removal previously gave up
  whenever the account's isolated browser profile was still open
  anywhere in the app and silently did nothing; deletion now releases
  the profile, retries around WebKit's asynchronous teardown, verifies
  the profile is gone, and shows an error if it still fails.
- Claude accounts now connect to the account's chat organization.
  Accounts whose Anthropic Console organization was listed first were
  bound to it and could never load usage data.
- Connecting a Claude account whose usage response the app cannot read
  now fails with an explanation instead of saving an account that never
  shows data.

### Changed

- Adding an account is now a two-step wizard: pick a provider, then
  sign in with the full sheet available to the login page.
- Claude connection and refresh failures are now logged to the system
  log (subsystem `com.fsck.agentic-usage-meter`) with structural
  details only, so bug reports can include diagnostics without exposing
  account data.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Releases are now built, signed, notarized, and published from GitHub
  Actions when a version tag is pushed, with the local release path kept as
  a fallback. This release is otherwise identical to 0.2.0.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Experimental Z.ai GLM Coding Plan connections using the account's Coding
  Plan API key.
- Experimental Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan connections using an isolated browser
  session, with the monthly bundle shown as remaining tokens.

### Changed

- Replaced the menu bar glyph with an open gauge so it no longer resembles
  Time Machine's clock icon.

### Fixed

- Claude usage refreshes no longer fail on accounts whose reset timestamps
  include fractional seconds.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-02

### Added

- First downloadable public release of the multi-provider macOS menu-bar usage
  meter.
- Qualified account connections for Claude, Codex, and Kimi, plus experimental
  connections for MiniMax, GitHub, Factory, OpenCode Go, OpenCode Zen, and
  SuperGrok.
- Collapsible quota-window and balance sections in the menu-bar panel and
  optional floating widget.
- Privacy-preserving local credential storage and direct provider requests,
  with no application server, analytics, or telemetry.
- Confirmation-based Sparkle update checks from signed GitHub Release assets.
- A provider-request link in the add-account screen for requesting additional
  integrations.

### Fixed

- Corrected the public author attribution to Jesse Vincent.
- Hardened release-feed validation against metadata split across separate
  items.

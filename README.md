# Agentic Usage Meter

Agentic Usage Meter is a macOS menu-bar app that shows coding-agent
subscription quota windows and balances across your accounts.

Built by [Jesse Vincent](https://fsck.com).

## What it shows

The menu-bar panel and optional floating widget show the remaining quota and
reset times returned for each connected account. Collapsible sections keep
five-hour, weekly, monthly, and Extra Credits information readable when you
have several accounts.

The app displays only quota windows and balances returned by the provider. It
does not invent missing five-hour, weekly, monthly, or credit rows.

## Providers

Qualified providers:

- Claude — isolated browser session
- Codex — ChatGPT OAuth in your browser
- Kimi — device authorization

Experimental providers:

- MiniMax — Token Plan API key
- GitHub — device OAuth
- Factory — per-account API key
- OpenCode Go — isolated OpenCode session
- OpenCode Zen — isolated OpenCode session
- SuperGrok — Grok device OAuth

Antigravity is unavailable because its CLI uses the shared macOS Keychain,
which cannot isolate separate accounts.

Provider names and logos are trademarks of their respective owners; inclusion
does not imply endorsement. See the
[provider-mark attribution](Sources/UsageMeterUI/Resources/ProviderMarks/ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Accounts and privacy

Agentic Usage Meter has no application server: requests go directly from your
Mac to each provider. OAuth tokens and API keys are stored in account-scoped
Keychain items. Claude and OpenCode cookies stay in account-scoped WebKit
profiles. Cached usage is stored in Application Support.

The app has no analytics or telemetry.

## Install

When a public build is available, download the latest notarized app from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/agentic-usage-meter/releases), move
it to Applications, and launch it.

## Build from source

Requirements: macOS 26 and Xcode 26 with Swift 6.2.

```sh
swift build --product AgenticUsageMeter
swift test
swift run AgenticUsageMeter --sample-data
```

`--sample-data` launches the app with synthetic values and a visible `SAMPLE
DATA` marker; it does not connect to an account.

For a locally signed app, run:

```sh
Scripts/build-and-run-local.sh
```

## Refresh behavior

The development build refreshes automatically no more often than once per
minute per provider account. Release builds use a ten-minute minimum.
Manual and on-demand refreshes share the same per-account limit, and provider
retry or backoff can make the interval longer.

## Terminal access

The application bundle includes a `usage-meter` command that prints the
quota picture the application last fetched. It reads the application's
state file and makes no network requests, so it returns immediately and
works whether or not the application is running.

```sh
"/Applications/Agentic Usage Meter.app/Contents/MacOS/usage-meter"
```

Link it onto your path to shorten that:

```sh
ln -s "/Applications/Agentic Usage Meter.app/Contents/MacOS/usage-meter" \
    /usr/local/bin/usage-meter
```

`usage-meter` prints a table. `usage-meter --json` prints a versioned
report for scripts. `usage-meter --tightest` prints one line for the
window with the least headroom, which suits a shell prompt or a status
line.

The table and `--tightest` print display names only. `--json` also
includes each account's authenticated identity, which is usually an
email address, so treat its output as you would the account list
itself.

The command exits 66 when the application has never written its state
file and 65 when that file cannot be decoded, so a prompt can tell an
unconfigured application from a broken one.

## Provider diagnostics

Provider APIs and returned usage data can change. See the
[provider qualification notes](docs/provider-qualification.md) for each
provider's current qualification status, authentication surface, and known
data limitations.

## Release and updates

Published builds are direct downloads from the
[latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/agentic-usage-meter/releases/latest).
The app checks the signed Sparkle feed automatically and asks for confirmation
before installing an update. Maintainers build, sign, notarize, verify, and
publish releases locally by following the [release guide](docs/releasing.md).
